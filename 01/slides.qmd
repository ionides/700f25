## Outline

- The pre-history of phylodynamics and its initial synthesis by \citet{Grenfell2004}.

    + Increases in the availability and length of genetic sequence data

    + Challenges for interpretation of the resulting trees of evolutionary relationships.

    + A need for model-based statistical inference

- A brief overview of advances 2005-2025 motivating this course.

    + Continuing growth in data collection and developments in inference methodology

    + Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic

    + Current challenges, scientific and statistical

## Glossary

* Pathogen. Virus, bacterium or other micro-organism which multiply in a host, causing disease.

* Phylogeny/genealogy. Ancestral tree for a group of individuals. Here, the individuals are pathogens.

* Epidemiology. The study of the cause and spread of disease, defaulting to infectious disease of humans.

* Immunity. Partial or complete protection from infection.

## What is phylodynamics?

__The forward problem__: How do observed phylogenies arise from "pathogen genetic variation, modulated by host immunity, transmission bottlenecks, and epidemic dynamics."

__The inverse problem__: Inferring disease dynamics from observed phylogenies. What scientific & public health questions can phylogenies address?

__Note__: raw data are genetic sequences (or possibly phenotype measurements) not trees. We may analyze derived data, "observed trees," or the raw data.

## The need for models and formal statistical inference

* Good descriptive statistics and graphics are important for data analysis.

* Formal quantitative inference also has a role.

    + Models about which we can make statistical statements to compare them to data.

    + What are the tools we need for quantitative phylodynamics?


## Reading Grenfell et al. (2004) as a statistical scientist in 2025.

* There are many words to look up on Google/Wikipedia.

* The paper focuses on the forward problem (how biology affects the observed tree).

* This raises the possibility of the inferential inverse problem, but does not tell you how to do the statistics.

* An example of a forward-looking review paper.

## Statistical/probabilistic abstraction

* Hosts are susceptible (S), infected/infectious (I), or recovered/removed (R).

* Chance interactions between S and I hosts lead to a transmission event ($S\rightarrow I$) and a new infection.
<!--
\begin{eqnarray}
S + I \rightarrow 2I
\end{eqnarray}
-->

* Supposing each new infection has a unique source, called its ancestor, this sequence of random infection events implies a random ancestral tree connecting any collection of observed individuals.

* Probability models of this kind, built up of random variables that determine how the process progresses through time, are called __stochastic processes__.

* The corresponding statistical inverse problem is __inference for stochastic processes__.
