## The Volz Coalescent

Volz, E. M., Kosakovsky Pond, S. L., Ward, M. J., Leigh Brown, A. J., & Frost, S. D. (2009). Phylodynamics of infectious disease epidemics. Genetics, 183(4), 1421&ndash;1430. https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.109.106021.

* Overview: Kingman's coalescent provides a link between the observed rate of coalescence, the _effective population size_ and the generation interval, in a fixed-size population.

* A time-varying population can be approximated as piecewise constant.
@Volz2009a noticed that this can be inappropriate for fast-changing populations and derived an alternative approach.


## Cluster size distributions

- Why are @Volz2009a interested in cluster size distribution? 

## The ancestor function

- $A(t,T)$ is defined as the  "fraction of the population at $t$ with sampled progeny extant at $T$.

- Does "population" here mean "host population, $N$" or "population of infected hosts, $\mathcal{I}$"?

- What roles are played by the assumption that the population size is large?


## Intuition

- From the introduction, "Coalescent rates are low near peak prevalence, but higher when there is a large ratio of incidence to prevalence."

  How is this evident?

## Definition or derivation?

- Consider equation (2):
$$\frac{\partial{A(t,T)}}{\partial{t}} = f_{SI}\,p_c.$$
Is this a definition of $A(t,T)$ for some model, or is it derived?

- Either way, once a model gives us $p_c(t,T)$, this defines a coalescent process having coalescent rate $f_{SI}\,p_c$.

- Note, this depends on the expected number of lineages (normalized as the large sample fraction) not the actual number.

## Likelihood

- Equation (12) is written in terms of $A(t,T)$, which is a property of the model not of the data.

  How can this be considered a likelihood?

## Sufficient statistics

- In the Introduction, Volz et al. claim that "...branching patterns provide information about the frequency of transmissions over time."

  This begs the question:
  What, according to @Volz2009a, are sufficient statistics for the frequency of transmissions over time?


## Comparison with the skyline plot

Does it indeed "...seem surprising that the SIR model based on ODEs outperforms the generalized skyline even in the presence of stochasticity at small population sizes"?
Why or why not?
