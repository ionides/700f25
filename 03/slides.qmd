## The Volz Coalescent

Volz, E. M., Kosakovsky Pond, S. L., Ward, M. J., Leigh Brown, A. J., & Frost, S. D. (2009). Phylodynamics of infectious disease epidemics. Genetics, 183(4), 1421-1430. https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.109.106021.

* Overview: Kimgman's coalescent provides a link between the observed rate of coalescence, the _effective population size_ and the generation interval, in a fixed-size population.

* A time-varying population can be approximated as piecewise constant.
Volz et al. (volz09) noticed that this can be inappropriate for fast-changing populations and derived an alternative approach.



## Cluster size distributions

- Why are \citep{Volz2009a} so interested in cluster size distribution? 

## The ancestor function

- $A(t,T)$ is defined as the  "fraction of the population at $t$ with sampled progeny extant at $T$.

  Does "population" here mean "host population, $N$" or "population of infected hosts, $\mathcal{I}$"?


## Intuition

- From the introduction, "Coalescent rates are low near peak prevalence, but higher when there is a large ratio of incidence to prevalence."

  How is this evident?


## Likelihood

- Equation (12) is written in terms of $A(t,T)$, which is a property of the model not of the data.

  How can this be considered a likelihood?
