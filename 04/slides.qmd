## Stadler (2010)

Stadler, T. (2010). Sampling-through-time in birth–death trees. _Journal of Theoretical Biology_, 267(3), 396-404. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010).

- Here, we start developing models for heterochronous genealogical trees (not all leaves are at the same time).

## Birth-death trees vs the coalescent

Stadler, T. (2009). On incomplete sampling under birth–death models and connections to the sampling-based coalescent. _Journal of Theoretical Biology_, 261(1), 58-66. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.07.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.07.018)

- Deals with homochronous sampling (i.e., all samples at the end time, $T$)

- Similar to Kingman's coalescent, but not identical

- What are the advantages and disadvantages?

## Definitions

- Notice the deletion of ancestors of unsampled lineages. We will call this _pruning_.

## Lemma 2.3

- How do you prove the first identity?

- You can always [ask AI](lem2-3.pdf)

- How do you know if AI got it right?

## Master equations

\begin{align*}
    \dot{p}_0(t) &= \mu - (\lambda + \mu + \psi) p_0(t) + \lambda p_0(t)^2, &\quad p_0(0) = 1 - \rho, \\
    \dot{p}_1(t) &= -(\lambda + \mu + \psi) p_1(t) + 2\lambda p_0(t)p_1(t), &\quad p_1(0) = \rho.
\end{align*}

- What are these, and where do they come from?

## An informal derivation

let $A_0(t)$, $A_1(t)$ be the events corresponding to $p_0(t)$, $p_1(t)$.
\begin{align}
& P[A_0(t+h)] = E\Big[ P\big[A_0(t+h) \, \big| \, \mbox{outcomes in $[t,t+h]$}\big]\Big] = \nonumber
\\
& \quad   (1- [\lambda+\mu+\phi] h ) P[A_0(t)]   
\\
& \qquad   + \lambda h (P[A_0])^2               
\\
& \qquad   + \mu h                              
\\
& \qquad   + o(h)
\end{align}
Now subtract $P[A_0(t)]$ from both sides, divide by $h$, and take a limit.

Note: we've passed a limit through expectation without justification.


## Theorem 3.1.

How did Stadler guess this solution?

## Theorem 3.5.

- This is a key result, since it gives the likelihood of a given genealogy under the linear birth-death-sampling model.

- How is this derived?
