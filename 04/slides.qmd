## Stadler (2010)

Stadler, T. (2010). Sampling-through-time in birth–death trees. _Journal of Theoretical Biology_, 267(3), 396-404. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010).

- Here, we start developing models for heterochronous genealogical trees (not all leaves are at the same time).

## Birth-death trees vs the coalescent

Stadler, T. (2009). On incomplete sampling under birth–death models and connections to the sampling-based coalescent. _Journal of Theoretical Biology_, 261(1), 58-66. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.07.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.07.018)

- Deals with homochronous sampling (i.e., all samples at the end time, $T$)

- Similar to Kingman's coalescent, but not identical

- What are the advantages and disadvantages?

## Definitions

- Notice the deletion of ancestors of unsampled lineages. We will call this _pruning_.
