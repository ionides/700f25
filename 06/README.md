This is a well-cited review paper. Much of it covers papers we have recently read, giving you a chance to think about applications of these methods. There are also hints about limitations of these methods that motivate the generalizations we will consider later.

As before, you can get your class participation credit by submitting ahead of class, in writing, a few sentences describing (i) something you got out of reading this paper; (ii) something you got stuck on trying to understand.
You can [email this to ionides@umich.edu and kingaa@umich.edu with subject "700 participation"](mailto:ionides@umich.edu;kingaa@umich.edu?subject=700%20participation).

Note that each class is graded with one point for attendance and one for participation.
