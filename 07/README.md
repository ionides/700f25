This is an important paper that represents the first attempt we have seen to grapple with the issue of population structure.

As before, you can get your class participation credit by submitting ahead of class, in writing, a few sentences describing (i) something you got out of reading this paper; (ii) something you got stuck on trying to understand.
You can [email this to ionides@umich.edu and kingaa@umich.edu with subject "700 participation"](mailto:ionides@umich.edu;kingaa@umich.edu?subject=700%20participation).

Note that each class is graded with one point for attendance and one for participation.
