## Outline

Volz, E. M. (2012)
Complex population dynamics and the coalescent under neutrality.
Genetics **190**: 187&ndash;201.
[doi:10.1534/genetics.111.134627](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.134627)

* The first approach to phylodynamic likelihood for a compartment model with a structured population

* Supposes that the model dynamics are determined by a system of differential equations

__Fig 6.__ (Left) Model with m = 5 states, four birth terms, and seven migration terms. Blue arrows are logistic birth terms. Red arrows are migration. (Center) The population size $Y_k$ over time for each of 5 states. (Right) Likelihood profile of four (relative) birth rates and 95% CIs.



## Branching process approximations

* Why does Volz describe his method as a branching process approximation?

* How is the branching process approximation related to the assumption of a large population with a low sampling fraction?

* How would you assess the inaccuracy incurred by the branching process approximation in a particular application?


## Deterministic population dynamics

* What are the benefits and weaknesses for data analysis of making an assumption of deterministic population dynamics?

    * This is a question about the population model, not its relationship to phylodynamic data.

* Is a branching process approximation to the phylodynamic model more suitable in a deterministic or stochastic population model, or are those decisions separate?



## The [Riccati equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccati_equation)

* How do you solve Eq. (20)?

* Is the proposed solution in Eq. (22) correct?
