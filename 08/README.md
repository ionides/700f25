# Class 8

Reading:
 Vaughan, T. G., & Stadler, T. (2025). Bayesian Phylodynamic Inference of Multitype Population Trajectories Using Genomic Data. _Molecular Biology and Evolution_, 42(6), msaf130. [https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf130](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf130).


This is a recent paper bringing us up-to-date with progress from the Stadler group on phylodynamic inference.
The model class generalizes the birth-death models of [Stadler (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.010) in a similar way to the way Volz (2012) generalized Volz et al. (2009).

The methods involve particle filters, building on previous work by [Vaughan et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz106) that proposes a filter methodology similar to the more complete framework developed by [King, Lin & Ionides (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2021.11.003).

As before, you can get your class participation credit by submitting ahead of class, in writing, a few sentences describing (i) something you got out of reading this paper; (ii) something you got stuck on trying to understand.
You can [email this to ionides@umich.edu and kingaa@umich.edu with subject "700 participation"](mailto:ionides@umich.edu;kingaa@umich.edu?subject=700%20participation).

Note that each class is graded with one point for attendance and one for participation.
