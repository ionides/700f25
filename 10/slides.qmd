## Outline

 Ki, & Terhorst (2022). Variational phylodynamic inference using pandemic-scale data. _Molecular Biology and Evolution_, 39(8), msac154. [https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac154](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac154).

1. How is variational inference applied to phylodynamic models?

2. The role of automatic differentation. 


## Bayesian vs non-Bayesian phylodynamic inference

* To what extent do you agree with the assertion that phylogenetic uncertainty is not reflected in frequentist point estimates but is included in Bayesian estimates?

## Approximations

* "A divide-and-conquer strategy where distant subtrees of a very large phylogeny are assumed to evolve approximately independently."

* "Assume that topological estimates of these subtrees are an accurate reflection of their distribution under the prior."
