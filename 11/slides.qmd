## Suggestions {.allowframebreaks}

1. Andréoletti et al. (2022).
The occurrence birth–death process for combined-evidence analysis in macroevolution and epidemiology.
_Systematic Biology_ syac037.
[https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac037](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac037).
Summarize the key methodological ideas, compare them with standard birth–death and coalescent approaches, and discuss their implications for macroevolutionary and epidemiological inference. Try reproducing a small example from the paper.

2. Experiment with [phylodeep](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/phylodeep). This package relates to Voznica et al. (2022). Deep learning from phylogenies to uncover the transmission dynamics of epidemics. _Nat Commun_ 13:3896 [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31511-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31511-0).
Three others proposed studying this paper.
In particular, in the new Compact Bijective Ladderized Vector (CBLV) representation developed to facilitate deep learning.

3. Reproducing results from Ki, C., & Terhorst, J. (2022). Variational phylodynamic inference using pandemic-scale data. _Molecular Biology and Evolution_, 39(8), msac154. [https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac154](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac154).

4. Reproducing results from King, A. A., Lin, Q., & Ionides, E. L. (2025). Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes. _ArXiv:2405.17032_. [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.17032](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.17032).

5. Reproducing results from King, A. A., Lin, Q., & Ionides, E. L. (2022). Markov genealogy processes. _Theoretical Population Biology_, 143, 77-91. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2021.11.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2021.11.003).

6. Reproducing results from Vaughan, T. G., & Stadler, T. (2025). Bayesian Phylodynamic Inference of Multitype Population Trajectories Using Genomic Data. _Molecular Biology and Evolution_, 42(6), msaf130. [https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf130](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf130).

7. Read Thompson, A, Liebeskind, BJ, Scully, EJ, & Landis, MJ. (2024). 
Deep learning and likelihood approaches for viral phylogeography converge on the same answers whether the inference model is right or wrong.
_Systematic Biology_ 73:183–206.
[https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syad074](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syad074).
(Suggested three times)
Perhaps try modifying the code to assess the effects of model misspecifcation, or varying amounts of data, or details of the BEAST pipeline.

8. Phylogeography. Inferring movement of humans, viruses, or other species from genetic data. Two people proposed this. In addition to (7), a suggested paper is De Maio, N, Wu, CH, O’Reilly, KM, & Wilson, D. (2015). 
New routes to phylogeography: a Bayesian structured coalescent approximation.
_PLOS Genetics_ 11:e1005421.
[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005421](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005421)

9. Sequential Markov coalescent to address recombination. There are relationships between demographic history of a population, time to most recent common ancestor at a given site in the genome, and linkage between sites. The Terhorst group has investigated such questions. What can be learned by comparison with other phylodynamic tools?

10. Zika as a study in sampling-aware phylodynamics with Nextstrain.
    Nextstrain build and example data: https://nextstrain.org/zika
    Repository with inputs and configuration: https://github.com/nextstrain/zika

11. Dengue to look at the role of competing serotypes.
    Nextstrain dengue portal with serotype-specific views (DENV1–DENV4): https://nextstrain.org/dengue
    Repository with workflows and curated inputs: https://github.com/nextstrain/dengue


## Other brainstorming ideas

12. Explain phylopomp (https://github.com/kingaa/phylopomp) to the class, perhaps in the context of the code for [King et al., 2025](https://github.com/kingaa/structured-genealogy-process-paper).

13. Extend or improve the analysis in Peter Yang's honors thesis on [Phylodynamic Inference of MERS-CoV Using Structured Markov Genealogy Processes](https://ionides.github.io/students/peter_yang_honors_thesis.pdf), which has [code on GitHub](https://github.com/kingaa/yang-phylopomp).
