# Class 14

Please submit your pdf slides to the Canvas assignment for class 14.

As a reminder, you should reckon on 5 minutes of presentation for each team member. There will be time for a brief question or two at the end of each project presentation. 

You can each submit your team pdf, or submit separate slides, depending on how your team is operating. A 5 minute talk probably should not have more than about 5 slides.
