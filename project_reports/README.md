# Final project reports

Please submit to Canvas a pdf giving additional details of your team project. This is expected to be a single document for the whole team (you can each submit a copy) but if your activities diverged then you are welcome to submit different reports. 

This can read more like a lab notebook report than a highly polished document. It should consist of notes of what you did for your investigation, some results (where applicable) and enough discussion to explain what was going on. It may help you to write in the formal Introduction-Methods-Results-Conclusion-References format, but this is not required. 

The deadline is flexible. Let the instructors know if you want an extension. The assumption is that, once you're presented your project, you will want to put together a short report and be done.
